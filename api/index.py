For example, we may retain Personal Information collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Service if your account has been banned or your access to the Services has been disabled for any reason. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

We limit the collection of Personal Information to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for those purposes.  \\n\\n* Security measures: We use appropriate measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the volume and nature of Personal Information processed and risk involved, considering the size, scope, and type of our business, and have implemented contractual, technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Notice does not guarantee the security of your Personal Information. In the event of a security breach, we will notify the proper regulatory authorities and any affected users of the breach within 72 hours after we become aware of the breach.\\n\\nYour Practices and Activities\\n\\nYour practices and activities are likewise very important for the protection of your Personal Information.

For example, we may retain Personal Information collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Service if your account has been banned or your access to our Services has been disabled for any reason.

Epileptic Seizure Warning. Please note that certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns, even if they have never experienced epileptic symptoms or been previously diagnosed with epilepsy. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain images on screens, including virtual reality headsets, or playing certain video games, including the Game. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when exposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing the Game. Stop playing the Game and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions; eye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision; involuntary movements; or disorientation. Another Axiom is not liable for any death, injury, or health complications resulting from any epileptic symptoms or conditions which may occur during or as a result of your use of the Game. To reduce the likelihood of a seizure or epileptic symptoms do not play the Game when tired or need sleep and take 10 or 15 minute breaks every 30 minutes while playing the Game.\\r\\n2. Motion Sickness. Playing video games (especially virtual reality games), including the Game, may cause motion sickness in some users. If you feel dizzy or nauseous when playing the Game, stop playing and rest. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in other demanding or strenuous activity until you feel better. To limit the risk of motion sickness while playing the Game, do not use the Game when you are tired, need sleep, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, are hung-over, have digestive problems, are under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or earaches or other health issues which may increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.\\r\\n3.

Play Area Precautions. Give yourself plenty of room to play the Game. Always be aware of your surroundings when playing the Game. While playing the Game in virtual reality you will be moving around the play area and using your hands to control gameplay. Make sure the play area is clear of furniture, objects, and other people that could be bumped into during gameplay. Please ensure that you are not near other people, stairs, balconies, windows, walls, furniture, or other objects that may pose a danger to you or could be damaged or injured during or immediately after using the Game. All objects that may pose tripping hazards, could cause injury, or could be damaged as the result of your contact with them while playing the Game should be removed from the play area prior to your or your family members playing the Game. A minimum six-feet-by-six-feet unobstructed play area is recommended for safe enjoyment of the Game. Never handle sharp or dangerous objects while playing the Game. Due to the immersive nature of the Game, sound volumes should be kept at low enough levels that you are able to maintain awareness of your surroundings while playing the Game and so as not to damage your hearing. You should not use the Game if your awareness of your surroundings is impaired by lack of sleep, drugs, alcohol, the effects of a hang-over, stress, anxiety, or when suffering from a cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or other illnesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>K.

Please note that certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns, even if they have never experienced epileptic symptoms or been previously diagnosed with epilepsy. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain images on screens, including virtual reality headsets, or playing certain video games, including the Game. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when exposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing the Game. Stop playing the Game and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions; eye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision, involuntary movements, or disorientation. Another Axiom is not liable for any death, injury, or health complications resulting from any epileptic symptoms or conditions which may occur during or as a result of your use of the Game.

Motion Sickness. Playing video games (especially virtual reality games), including the Game, may cause motion sickness in some users. If you feel dizzy or nauseous when playing the Game, stop playing and rest. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in other demanding or strenuous activities until you feel better. To limit the risk of motion sickness while playing the Game, do not use the Game when you are tired, need sleep, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, are hung-over, have digestive problems, are under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches, migraines, earaches, or other health issues which may increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.\\n3.

Play Area Precautions. Give yourself plenty of room to play the Game. Always be aware of your surroundings when playing the Game. While playing the Game in virtual reality you will be moving around the play area and using your hands to control gameplay.

Please ensure that you are not near other people, stairs, balconies, windows, walls, furniture, or other objects that may pose a danger to you or could be damaged or injured during or immediately after using the Game. All objects that may pose tripping hazards, could cause injury, or could be damaged as the result of your contact with them while playing the Game should be removed from the play area prior to you playing the Game. A minimum six-feet-by-six-feet unobstructed play area is recommended for safe enjoyment of the Game. Never handle sharp or dangerous objects while playing the Game. Due to the immersive nature of the Game, sound volumes should be kept at low enough levels so that you are able to maintain awareness of your surroundings while playing the Game and so as not to damage your hearing.

These health and safety precautions are not intended to be an exhaustive list, and use of the Game may involve other health and safety risks not contained below. Another Axiom is not liable for any damage to property, injury, or death that may occur as the result of your failure to review the health and safety precautions or as a result of the interactions between you or your family members and people or objects in or around the play area during your use of the Game.\\n1. Epileptic Seizure Warning. Please note that certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns, even if they have never experienced epileptic symptoms or been previously diagnosed with epilepsy. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain images on screens, including virtual reality headsets, or playing certain video games, including the Game. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when exposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing the Game. Stop playing the Game and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions; eye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision, involuntary movements, or disorientation. Another Axiom is not liable for any death, injury, or health complications resulting from any epileptic symptoms or conditions which may occur during or as a result of your use of the Game. To reduce the likelihood of a seizure or epileptic symptoms do not play the Game when tired or need sleep, and take 10- or 15-minute breaks every 30 minutes while playing the Game.\\n2. Motion Sickness. Playing video games (especially virtual reality games), including the Game, may cause motion sickness in some users. If you feel dizzy or nauseous when playing the Game, stop playing and rest. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in other demanding or strenuous activities until you feel better. To limit the risk of motion sickness while playing the Game, do not use the Game when you are tired, need sleep, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, are hung-over, have digestive problems, are under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches, migraines, earaches, or other health issues which may increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.\\n3. Repetitive Motion Injuries and Eyestrain. Playing video games, including the Game, can make your muscles, joints, skin, or eyes hurt. To avoid problems such as tendinitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, skin irritation, or eyestrain: avoid excessive play; take a 10- to 15-minute break every 30 minutes while playing the Game; if your hands, wrists, arms, eyes, or other parts of your body become tired or sore while playing, or if you feel symptoms such as tingling, numbness, burning, or stiffness, stop and rest for several hours before playing again; and if you continue to have any of the above symptoms or other discomfort during or after playing the Game, stop playing and consult a doctor.\\n4. Play Area Precautions. Give yourself plenty of room to play the Game. Always be aware of your surroundings when playing the Game. While playing the Game in virtual reality you will be moving around the play area and using your hands to control gameplay. Make sure the play area is clear of furniture, objects, and other people that could be bumped into during gameplay. Please ensure that you are not near other people, stairs, balconies, windows, walls, furniture, or other objects that may pose a danger to you or could be damaged or injured during or immediately after using the Game. All objects that may pose tripping hazards, could cause injury, or could be damaged as the result of your contact with them while playing the Game should be removed from the play area prior to you playing the Game. A minimum six-feet-by-six-feet unobstructed play area is recommended for safe enjoyment of the Game. Never handle sharp or dangerous objects while playing the Game. Due to the immersive nature of the Game, sound volumes should be kept at low enough levels so that you are able to maintain awareness of your surroundings while playing the Game and so as not to damage your hearing. You should not use the Game if your awareness of your surroundings is impaired by lack of sleep, drugs, alcohol, the effects of a hangover, stress, anxiety, or when suffering from a cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or other illnesses.\\n\\n10.

If you or anyone in your family\\nhas ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when\\nexposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing the Game. Stop\\nplaying the Game and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions;\\neye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision, involuntary\\nmovements, or disorientation. Another Axiom is not liable for any death, injury, or health\\ncomplications resulting from any epileptic symptoms or conditions which may occur during or as\\na result of your use of the Game.

If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when exposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing our Games. Stop playing our Games and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions; eye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision, involuntary movements, or disorientation.

Failing to review the below health and safety precautions may cause damage to property, injury, or death. These health and safety precautions are not intended to be an exhaustive list, and use of our Games may involve other health and safety risks not contained below. \\n\\nAnother Axiom is not liable for any damage to property, injury, or death that may occur as the result of your failure to review the health and safety precautions or as a result of the interactions between you or your family members and people or objects in or around the play area during your use of our Games.\\n\\nEpileptic Seizure Warning. Please note that certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns, even if they have never experienced epileptic symptoms or been previously diagnosed with epilepsy. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain images on screens, including virtual reality headsets, or playing certain video games, including our Games. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when exposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing our Games. Stop playing our Games and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions; eye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision, involuntary movements, or disorientation. Another Axiom is not liable for any death, injury, or health complications resulting from any epileptic symptoms or conditions which may occur during or as a result of your use of our Games.

Playing video games (especially virtual reality games), including our Games, may cause motion sickness in some users. If you feel dizzy or nauseous when playing our Games, stop playing and rest. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in other demanding or strenuous activities until you feel better. To limit the risk of motion sickness while playing our Games, do not use our Games when you are tired, need sleep, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, are hung-over, have digestive problems, are under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches, migraines, earaches, or other health issues which may increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.\\n\\nRepetitive Motion Injuries and Eyestrain.

Give yourself plenty of room to play our Games. Always be aware of your surroundings when playing our Games. While playing our Games in virtual reality you will be moving around the play area and using your hands to control gameplay. Make sure the play area is clear of furniture, objects, and other people that could be bumped into during gameplay. Please ensure that you are not near other people, stairs, balconies, windows, walls, furniture, or other objects that may pose a danger to you or could be damaged or injured during or immediately after using our Games. All objects that may pose tripping hazards, could cause injury, or could be damaged as the result of your contact with them while playing our Games should be removed from the play area prior to you playing our Games. A minimum six-feet-by-six-feet unobstructed play area is recommended for safe enjoyment of our Games. Never handle sharp or dangerous objects while playing our Games.

OUR SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, AND PRODUCTS (INCLUDING OUR GAMES AND OTHER SOFTWARE) INCLUDED IN OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY ANOTHER AXIOM ON AN \\u201CAS-IS\\u201D AND \\u201CAS-AVAILABLE\\u201D BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANOTHER AXIOM DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NEITHER ANOTHER AXIOM NOR ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER AXIOM REPRESENTS OR WARRANTS THAT OUR SERVICES, THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, AND PRODUCTS (INCLUDING OUR GAMES AND SOFTWARE) INCLUDED IN OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH OUR SERVICES, OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM ANOTHER AXIOM, WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, ERROR-FREE, OR UNINTERRUPTED, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT OUR SERVICES OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES THEM AVAILABLE TO YOU ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT OUR SERVICES WILL OTHERWISE MEET YOUR NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS.\\n\\nYOU ASSUME ALL RISKS RELATING TO YOUR ONLINE OR OFFLINE COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS OF OUR SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ANOTHER AXIOM DOES NOT SCREEN OR INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ANY USERS OF OUR SERVICES. ANOTHER AXIOM MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF USERS OF OUR SERVICES. YOU AGREE TO TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS IN ALL COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS OF OUR SERVICES, PARTICULARLY IF YOU DECIDE TO MEET OFFLINE OR IN PERSON.\\n\\nTHE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.\\n\\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY\\n\\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL Another Axiom OR its affiliates or its or their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, contractors, agents, licensors, licensees, service providers, suppliers, successors, or assigns BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH (A) THESE TERMS, (B) THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE OUR SERVICES, OR (C) ANY COMMUNICATIONS, INTERACTIONS, OR MEETINGS WITH OTHER USERS OF OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE.\\n\\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL ANOTHER AXIOM\\u2019S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH (A) THESE TERMS, (B) THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE OUR SERVICES, OR (C) ANY COMMUNICATIONS, INTERACTIONS, OR MEETINGS WITH OTHER USERS OF OUR SERVICES, EXCEED ONE THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($1,000.00 USD). THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN ANOTHER AXIOM AND YOU.\\n\\nTHE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.\\n\\nIndemnification\\n\\nYou agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Another Axiom and its affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, contractors, agents, licensors, licensees, service providers, suppliers, successors, and assigns (each, an \\u201CIndemnified Party\\u201D) from and against any and all loss and damage, including, without limitation, reasonable fees and costs of counsel, incurred by any Indemnified Party in any claim, action, or proceeding arising out of or in connection with your violation of these Terms or your use of our Services. You agree to reimburse the Indemnified Party on demand and after the Indemnified Party provides reasonable proof for any payment made or loss suffered to which the foregoing indemnity applies.\\n\\nARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS \\n\\nPlease read this Section 20 (the \\u201CArbitration Agreement\\u201D) carefully. It affects your legal rights. It provides for resolution of most disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. This Section 20 (ARBITRATION AGREEMENT) also contains a jury trial waiver and a waiver of any and all rights to proceed in class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative action in arbitration or litigation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\\n\\nArbitration. You and Another Axiom agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Another Axiom, including, without limitation, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof or the Services (collectively, \\u201CDisputes\\u201D), whether such Disputes arose before, on, or subsequent to you entering these Terms, will be exclusively resolved by individual, binding arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including, without limitation, issues of arbitrability, issues relating to whether these Terms are unconscionable or illusory, in whole or in part, and any defense to arbitration, including, without limitation, waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.\\n\\nInjunctive or Other Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding anything contrary herein, each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. In addition, (i) the parties each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party\\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights (including anti-circumvention claims or any other related statutory rights) (an \\u201CIP Equity Action\\u201D), and (ii) Another Axiom retains the right to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction arising out of or relating to your violation of Section 8 (Prohibited Uses). You agree any Disputes arising out of or related to (i) and (ii) will be governed by Delaware law and controlling United States federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction to the contrary, and any such Disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. \\n\\nClass Action and Jury Trial Waivers. You acknowledge and agree that you and Another Axiom are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Another Axiom otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), or representative proceeding. If any court or arbitrator determines that this Subsection (c) (Class Action and Jury Trial Waivers) is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed null and void in its entirety, and you and Another Axiom will be deemed not to have agreed to arbitrate the Disputes. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this Section 20 (Arbitration Agreement) will survive any termination of these Terms. To the extent that any Disputes are allowed to proceed on a class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), or representative basis, such Disputes must be governed by Delaware law and controlling United States federal law, and litigated in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and the parties agree that litigation of those Disputes will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Disputes in arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Another Axiom may participate in a class-wide settlement.\\n\\nOpt-out Procedures. To opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement, you must send Another Axiom a written opt-out notice (\\u201COpt-Out Notice\\u201D) by email at\\u00A0support@anotheraxiom.com\\u00A0within 30 days from the Effective Date or the date that you first accessed the Services, whichever is later (\\u201COpt-Out Period\\u201D). The Opt-Out Notice must contain your full legal name, your complete mailing and email address, a clear statement that you wish to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement, and your signature. If your Opt-Out Period has passed, you are not eligible to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement will have no effect on any future arbitration agreements you may enter into with Another Axiom. As stated above, if you do not opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within the Opt-Out Period, then you will be bound to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement. If you timely provide Another Axiom with a valid Opt-Out Notice, you agree that all Disputes will be governed by Delaware law and controlling United States federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction to the contrary, and any such Disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.\\n\\nArbitration JAMS Rules. All Disputes will be submitted to\\u00A0JAMS\\u00A0for arbitration before one arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS clauses, rules, and procedures (the \\u201CJAMS Rules\\u201D) or the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and Mass Arbitration Fee Schedule (the \\u201CJAMS Mass Arbitration Rules\\u201D) (as applicable) then in effect, except as modified by this Section 20 (Arbitration Agreement). The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 20 (Arbitration Agreement). If 75 or more similar Demands for Arbitration are presented by or with the assistance, coordination, or cooperation of the same law firm, group of law firms, cooperating law firms, or organization, the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules will apply. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) will preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under the laws of Delaware.\\n\\nMandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. You and Another Axiom agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective, and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, in the event of a Dispute, you and Another Axiom each agree to send the other party a written Notice of Dispute (\\u201CNotice of Dispute\\u201D or \\u201CNotice\\u201D). A Notice of Dispute from you to Another Axiom must be emailed to\\u00A0legal@anotheraxiom.com (\\u201CNotice Address\\u201D). Any Notice of Dispute must include (i) the claimant\\u2019s full legal name, complete mailing address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the Dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding claimant\\u2019s use of the Services; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\\u2019s dispute. Another Axiom will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address (or another form of contact information) it has for you. After receipt of a Notice of Dispute, the parties will engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and Another Axiom agree that, after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period), and both parties will attend (with counsel, if represented). You and Another Axiom agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) will work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually-convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. Compliance with this mandatory Notice and informal dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Subsection (f) (Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure). If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, the parties agree that a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or stay the prosecution of an arbitration. Nothing in this Subsection (f) (Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure) limits the right of a party to seek damages in arbitration for non-compliance with this Section 20 (Arbitration Agreement).\\n\\nArbitration Location and Procedure. If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute after complying with Subsection (f) (Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure), a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable). If the Dispute does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Another Axiom submit to the arbitrator, unless the parties agree otherwise or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the Dispute exceeds $10,000, a party\\u2019s right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable). Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place in San Francisco County, California, or such other place agreed upon by the parties consistent with both parties\\u2019 right to reasonable access to arbitration. Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable). The arbitrator\\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. An arbitrator\\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied will not be entered in any court. The arbitrator\\u2019s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 18 (Limitation of Liability) as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).\\n\\nConfidentiality. The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award, and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.\\n\\nOpt-out of Future Changes to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 23 (Changes to these Terms), if Another Axiom makes any future material changes to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject any such change by sending an email to\\u00A0support@anotheraxiom.com\\u00A0within 30 days of the date of the posting of that change that provides (i) your full legal name and (ii) a description of the change(s) you are rejecting. This will not qualify as an Opt-Out Notice. To opt-out of the entire Arbitration Agreement, you must comply with Subsection (d) (Opt-Out Procedures).  \\n\\nWaiver and Severability\\n\\nNo waiver by Another Axiom of any term or condition set out in these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Another Axiom to assert a right under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right. \\n\\nIf any provision, or portion thereof, of these Terms is held by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of Section 20 (Arbitration Agreement) above or a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, or portion thereof, will be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.\\n\\nEntire Agreement\\n\\nThese Terms together with our Privacy Policy, our Fan Content & Mod Policy, and our other community policies that may be posted by Another Axiom constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Another Axiom regarding our Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding their subject matter.\\n\\nChanges to these Terms\\n\\nWe may revise and update these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion.
